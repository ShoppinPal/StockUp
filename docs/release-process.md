# Prerequisites
The release require the following tools installed on the host:
- Installation

  ```  brew install git-flow  ```
- Initialize git-clow for the project

  ``` git checkout master && git-flow init -d ```

# To get started with a new release
Create a branch, update version, and add release notes by running `make-branch`
```
./script/release/make-branch
```
As part of this script you'll be asked to:
1. Update the version in package.json and npm-shrinkwrap.json
2. Write release notes in CHANGELOG.txt

  Almost every feature enhancement should be mentioned, with the most visible/exciting ones first. Use descriptive sentences and give context where appropriate.

  Bug fixes are worth mentioning if it's likely that they've affected lots of people, or if they were regressions in the previous version.

  Improvements to the code are not worth mentioning.

# To release a version
```
./script/releases/push-release
```

# If itâ€™s a minor release (1.x.0), rather than a patch release (1.x.y)
1.Open a PR against develop to:

1. update CHANGELOG.txt to bring it in line with release.

2. bump the version in package.json and npm-shrinkwrap.json to the next minor version number with dev appended. For example, if you just released 1.4.0, update it to 1.5.0dev.

2.Get the PR merged.
